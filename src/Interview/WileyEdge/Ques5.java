/*Raman was playing a game,  he starts with x coins. Now in every step, he wins and loses and he has to get the money
 or pay the money as needed. He came in contact with a psychic who can see the future and the
  Psychic predicted the outcomes after each step. Now Raman wants to start the game with the minimum wage
   where he doesnâ€™t run out of money.  Help Raman to find what money he should start with. The only rule
   to keep playing is not going in a credit situation.
